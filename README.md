## Background
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Create a map using leaflet that does the following:
- Plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- Uses data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
- Ensure earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
- Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- Has a legend that will provide context for your map data.
